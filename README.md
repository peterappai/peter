## About Peter

What would you do if your beloved pet ran away from home? Wander around the streets? Ask if anyone saw where your pet went? Hand out flyers? Thanks to our new app called “Peter”, you can find your pet with ease. All you have to do is to upload pictures of your pet and “Pet Finder” will compare these photos with other previously uploaded pets and show all the possible matches, using image segmentation and deep learning. You can also help the other owners by taking pictures of stray animals as you walk down the street. Helping the other owners which are looking for their lost pets will get you a discount on our merchandise in our store which you can find on our website.
 
#### Adopt a friend 
 
Adopt a new pet, using “Pet Adopter”. Save the lives of many animals. Help the lost pets return to their warm homes to their worried owners. You can also contact your vet any time you like, to get information about the health of your beloved friend, vaccination dates, and so on.
